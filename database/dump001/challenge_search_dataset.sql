the configuration system provides the ability for administrators to customize the site and to move and synchronize configuration changes between development sites and the live site it does this in 2 ways providing storage for configuration providing a process in which configuration changes can be imported and exported between instances of the same site for example from dev to staging to live  what is configuration data  configuration data describes settings that define how your site behaves or is displayed for example when a site administrator updates settings using an administrative form these settings are stored as configuration data configuration data describes settings as simple as a site name and as complex as a view or image style what kinds of configuration are there  active configuration active configuration is the current working configuration of a site storage of active configuration is defined by the site and resides in the database by default simple configuration a simple configuration item is a group of settings such as the settings for a module or theme each simple configuration item has its own unique structure configuration entities configuration entities are userdefined configuration items grouped by type such as views image styles and content types each configuration entity within a type has a similar structure default configuration default configuration can be defined by a module theme or installation profile in its config install or config optional directories configuration is provided in yaml files file extension yml yaml is a humanreadable data serialization standard that is used by the core software for several purposes once the default configuration has been imported into the site s active configuration through installing the extension that configuration is owned by the site not the extension this means that future updates of the extension will not override the site s active configuration for that extension what is configuration synchronization  configuration synchronization is the process of exporting and importing configuration to keep configuration synchronized between different versions of a site for example between a development site and the live site each site has unique identifier also called a uuid  which identifies the site to the system in any instance of the site as long as the site instances have been reproduced as clones cloning is when the codebase and database are copied to create a new site instance when site instances are cloned a dev instance of the site has the same uuid as the live instance when site instances share the same uuid configuration can be exported from one instance to another the following list contains terms and concepts related to configuration synchronization exported configuration when configuration is exported the active configuration is exported as a set of files in yaml format when using the configuration synchronization administrative ui configuration can be exported as a fullexport or singleitem archive this archive can then be imported into the destination site instance imported configuration imported configuration is configuration that has been exported from another instance of the site the source and is now being imported into another site instance the destination thereby updating its active configuration to match the imported configuration data set configuration sync directory the configuration sync directory location is set in the site s settingsphp file when configuration is exported the active configuration is exported and described in yaml files which are stored in the configuration sync directory after the first export the system compares the site s active configuration with the configuration data in the sync directory and will only export active configuration items that are different than their counterparts in the sync directory managing configuration overview configuration management tasks such as exporting or importing configuration and synchronizing configuration can be done either through the administrative ui provided by the core configuration manager module or a commandline interface cli tool defining a configuration sync directory path other than the default value requires read write access to the site s settingsphp file most modules and themes also provide

some configuration such as field labels may also be visible to site visitors state is temporary data about the state of your site such as the last time the system cron jobs ran session is a subset of state information related to users interactions with the site such as site cookies and whether or not they are logged in what is a content entity  a content entity  or more commonly  entity  is an item of content data which can consist of text html markup images attached files and other data content entities are grouped into entity types  which have different purposes and are displayed in very different ways on the site most entity types are also divided into entity subtypes  which are divisions within an entity type to allow for smaller variations in how the entities are used and displayed for example the content item entity type that stores pagelevel content is divided into content type subtypes the content block entity type has block types  but the user entity type for user profile information does not have subtypes what is a field  within entity items the data is stored in individual fields  each of which holds one type of data such as formatted or plain text images or other files or dates fields can be added by an administrator on entity subtypes so that all entity items of a given entity subtype have the same collection of fields available and they can be singlevalued or multiplevalued when you create or edit entity items you are specifying the values for the fields on the entity item what is a reference field  a reference field is a field that stores a relationship between an entity and one or more other entities which may belong to the same or different entity type for example a content reference field on a content type stores a relationship between one content item and one or more other content items what field types are available  the following field types are provided by the core system and core modules many more are provided by contributed modules boolean number provided by the core system stores true false values and numbers comment provided by the core comment module allows users to add comments to an entity date timestamp datetime module stores dates and times date range datetime range module stores time date periods with a start and an end email core system stores email addresses link link module stores urls and link text list options module stores values chosen from predefined lists where the values can be numbers or text see section below for more on list fields reference core system stores entity references see section above telephone telephone module stores telephone numbers text text module stores formatted and unformatted text see section below for more on text fields what settings are available for list field types  list fields associate predefined keys  or value codes with labels that the user sees for example you might define a list field that shows the user the names of several locations while behind the scenes a location code is stored in the database each list field type corresponds to one type of stored key for example a list integer  field stores integers while the list text  field stores text strings once you have chosen the field type the main setting for a list field is the allowed values list which associates the keys with the labels what types of text fields are available  there are several types of text fields with different characteristics text fields can be either plain or formatted  plain text fields do not contain html while formatted fields can contain html and are processed through text filters  these are provided by the core filter module if you have that module enabled see the related topic below on filters for more information text fields can also be regularlength with a limit of 255 characters or long  with a very large character limit and long formatted text fields can include a summary attribute all possible combinations of these characteristics exist as text field types for example  text plain  and text formatted long with summary  are two examples of text field types what is a formatter  a formatter is a way to display a field most field types offer several types of formatters and most formatters have settings that further define how the field is displayed it is also possible to completely hide a field from display and you have the option of showing or hiding the field s label when it is displayed what is a widget  a widget is a way to edit a field some field types such as plain text singleline fields have only one widget available in this case a singleline text input field other field types offer choices for the widget for example singlevalued list fields can use a select or radio button widget for editing many widget types have settings that further define how the field can be edited managing content structure overview besides the field modules listed in the previous section there are additional core modules that you can use to manage your content structure the core node comment content block custom menu links user file image media taxonomy and contact modules all provide content entity types the core field ui module provides a user interface for managing fields and their display on entities the core layout builder module provides a more flexible user interface for configuring the display of
